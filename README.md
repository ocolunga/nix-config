# NIX CONFIGURATION

This repository contains the configuration files for my Nix and Nix Darwin setups.

It's currently deprecated.

The Nix package manager is a powerful tool, but it's not for everyone. My main reasons for deprecating this setup are:

### The time and effort it takes to maintain it: 

While the learning curve is steep, it's not my main concern. But, my time and most importantly, my attention, are limited resources. I'd rather spend them on my projects and work than on maintaining my system.

### The toll it takes on my system's hardware:

The reason I started using Nix was to have a reproducible setup across different machines, since I use multiple Macs for work and personal projects and a couple of Linux systems for servers and tinkering. 

For my Linux systems, Nix is a great fit. But for my Macs, it's a different story. The overhead of running Nix on macOS is significant, especially with their soldered SSDs. Which makes the drive to wear out faster than it should.

I might revisit Nix in the future, because I still think it's a great tool. Just not for my current needs.
